# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-09)

**Core value:** Recruiters and hiring managers who visit this site should immediately see Jack as someone worth interviewing
**Current focus:** v1.3 Chat Visibility — defining requirements

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-05-09 — Milestone v1.3 started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All milestone-level decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Full plan-level decision history retained in `.planning/milestones/v1.2-phases/*/SUMMARY.md` and `.planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md`.

v1.3 architectural decisions (locked at `/gsd-new-milestone` 2026-05-09):

- **Storage = Cloudflare KV** (not D1) — no aggregation/search needed; Jack reads every transcript in entirety
- **Delivery = Resend transactional email** — justified new runtime dep; v1.2 "zero new runtime deps preferred" rule overridden when there's real need
- **Cadence = hourly cron + 2-hour inactivity threshold** — generous; conversations virtually guaranteed not to fragment across emails
- **Posture = silent logging** — no in-UI disclosure; data never leaves Cloudflare → Gmail
- **Filter = none** — site traffic low enough to read every conversation; no recruiter-vs-visitor classification

### Open Blockers (carried into v1.3)

The following items move into v1.3 scope as the chat tech debt sweep:

- `CHAT_RATE_LIMITER` Cloudflare binding never configured on Production or Preview (pre-existing Phase 7 carry-forward; rate-limiter code path defensively skips when binding absent — code path byte-identical from Phase 7). Tracked at `.planning/todos/pending/2026-04-23-configure-chat-rate-limiter-binding.md`.
- Chat cache-hit-rate observability not yet wired (Phase 14 deferred). Tracked at `.planning/todos/pending/2026-04-23-chat-cache-hit-rate-observability.md`.
- `build:chat-context:check` not enforced in CI — deploy auto-regenerates so production never stale, but PRs cannot fail-fast on local drift. Recommended remediation: parallel job in `.github/workflows/sync-check.yml`.
- `#chat-panel` JS-coupled display contract — `animatePanelOpen` flips `style.display='flex'` directly while `.is-open` only animates. Fragile but no current break (WARNING).
- WR-01 bootstrap listener registers without dedup (`analytics.ts:140-147`, `scroll-depth.ts:63-70`, `chat.ts:870-877`) — no observable double-count due to `*Initialized` guards, but long sessions could accumulate listeners.

Carry-forwards NOT in v1.3 scope (out-of-scope for this milestone):

- Mobile menu breakpoint 380px → 768px UX revision (`.planning/todos/pending/2026-04-15-change-mobile-menu-breakpoint-from-380px-to-768px.md`).
- OG default image authoring (`.planning/todos/pending/2026-04-15-design-and-ship-og-default-image.md`).

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-05-09T00:00:00Z
Stopped at: v1.3 milestone summary confirmed; PROJECT.md + STATE.md updated; about to ask research decision and define requirements.
Resume file: .planning/PROJECT.md (Current Milestone: v1.3 Chat Visibility section)
Next command: continue `/gsd-new-milestone` flow → research decision → REQUIREMENTS.md → roadmap
